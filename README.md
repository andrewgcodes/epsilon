## In a nutshell
Essentially, Delta is a way to disconnect mathematical ideas and the descriptions of them. In the same way that Rx is a method of implementing the pub/sub paradigm in Rx`n` language (i.e. RxSwift, RxJS, etc,) Sigma is a way of implementing mathematical ideas in programming languages.

## Implications
This means that there would be a DeltaSwift, DeltaTS, and so on. For now, the project focuses on figuring out how to deal with mathematical expressions and figure in pseudocode, independently of any programming language. Once this abstract framework is finished, we can then begin implementation in different languages.
